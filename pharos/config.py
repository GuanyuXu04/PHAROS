"""
Hardware and feature-selection defaults for the Pharos package.

These constants describe the physical waveguide setup. Edit this file to
match a different sensor configuration, or pass overrides directly to
WaveguideDataset (e.g. when running ablations).

Each captured optical row contains ``(num_leds + 1) * (num_pds + 1) + 1``
floats: a leading timestamp followed by every (LED, PD) cross-reading,
where index 0 of each axis is the "off" baseline and indices 1..N are
the active emitters/detectors.
